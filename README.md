Abstract:


In urbanized area humans spend their time indoors and with the advent of closed
and completely sealed buildings and centralized air-conditioning systems, the indoor
environment has become more susceptible to diseases and discomfort of the occupants.
This is due to the fact that the the air-conditioning systems have been used primarily
for cooling the rooms, but pay less or no attention to the comfort of the occupants.
On top of compromising user comfort, buildings amount to nearly 40% of total energy
consumption, it is time that the building sector plays a key role in climate policy.
With limited access to renewable energy resources, it is a challenge for Singapore to
reduce the energy consumption of building and provide comfort to its occupants. It is
noted that the HVAC systems accounts for 40% of the total energy consumed by the
buildings. Since improvising the HVAC system can reduce the energy cost considerably
it is becoming more attractive . While energy cost reduction is important, the indoor
environmental quality (IEQ) is equally important to improve the productivity of the
occupants. IEQ collectively refers to the Indoor Air Quality, Lighting Quality, Acoustic
quality, Thermal Quality and Comfort of Human Beings in the building space. Since
IEQ is an ensemble of features, which is the result of interplay of many subsystems in
buildings, this project focuses on IEQ monitoring and integrated subsystem operations.
The project also looks into the scope of multi-agent assisted feedback to the system to
improvise the comfort of the occupants and reduce the energy consumptio
